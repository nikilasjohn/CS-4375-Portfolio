 This pdf contains my answers to the portfolio assignment
 
 You can access the file through [this link](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## C++ Data Exploration
 This section will detail how I coded functions to calculate the mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation between two variables
 
 The C++ code can be access through [this link](1_C++_Data_Exploration/1_C++_Data_Exp.cpp)
