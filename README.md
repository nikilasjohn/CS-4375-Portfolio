# CS 4375 Portfolio
 This repo will contain all of the work I do in my Machine Learning class

## Overview of ML
 This pdf contains my answers to the portfolio assignment
 
 You can access the file through [this link](Overview_of_ML.pdf)

## C++ Data Exploration
 This section will detail how I coded functions to calculate the mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation between two variables
 
 The C++ code can be access through [this link](1_C++_Data_Exploration/1_C++_Data_Exp.cpp)
 
 The documentation/overview of this can be accessed through [this link](1_C++_Data_Exploration/1_Documentation.pdf)
 
## Linear Models
 In this assignment, I was able to see the interaction of different regression techniques on a dataset of my choosing.
 
 I chose a dataset which contained all of YouTube's trending videos that appeared in the US over the course of several months.
 
 The notebook I made on Linear Regression can be found [here](2_Linear_Models/Regression.pdf)
 
 The notebook I made on Logical Regression can be found [here](2_Linear_Models/Classification.pdf)
 
 Lastly, the dataset I used can be found in [this directory](2_Linear_Models)

## ML Algorithms From Scratch
 In this assignment, I recreated R commands in C++ to get a deeper understanding on how they work
 
 This assignment called for me to recreate logistic regression (complete) and Naive Bayes (incomplete) using the titanic_project.csv dataset
 The Naive Bayes C++ program is completed up to the final step where you determine the raw data
 
 Code:
  [Logistic Regression](CS-4375-Portfolio/3_Scratch_Algorithms/LogReg.cpp)
  [Naive Bayes](CS-4375-   Portfolio/3_Scratch_Algorithms/NBayes.cpp)
 
 The report can be accessed [here](CS-4375-Portfolio/3_Scratch_Algorithms/Overview.pdf)
